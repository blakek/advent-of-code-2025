# [Advent of Code - 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)

> A list of solutions for the Advent of Code 2025.

If you're not familiar with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), it's a list of programming puzzles released every year. Most days in December, a new puzzle is released. Each puzzle has 2 parts, and you can solve them however you want.

## Usage

This repository contains an `aoc` script that can be used to run the solutions. Here's some example usages:

```bash
# See all the available commands
./aoc help

# Run the current day's solutions against the input using the first folder found in the day's directory
./aoc run

# Run day 1 part 2 in the TypeScript solution folder
./aoc run typescript 1 2
```
